# mcsg-pvpbot
Play classic mcsg with this pvp bot

The bot will roam the map in the hunt for players and will attack on sight. It will automatically eat when hungry, and will calm down once the game is over.

The bot uses "say commands" to join the same lobby as you. Eg; type into chat "say /join sg 19". 

The bot does not open chests and I will not be contributing to this project any more, so instead, op bot and it will give itself a wooden sword and some armor on spawn and focus on hunting players. 

To use, have node installed and run "node mcsgbot.js"

This project has the following dependencies:

node

mineflayer

mineflayer-pvp

mineflayer-pathfinder

mineflayer-armor-manager

These can be installed using 'npm install -r requirements.txt'
